1. install flac via commandline:
$	sudo apt-get install flac

2. install PyAudio (for microphone support) and SpeechRecognition (self-explanatory):
$	sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio 
$	sudo pip install SpeechRecognition

3. add user to audio group (TODO: figure out cleaner way to do this, e.g. with JACK, b/c adding a specific user to the audio group is apparently sketch.)

4. par-tay. also do other stuff probably.
